        <!--In CSS there are SELECTORS, CLASSES, and IDs. You can use SELECTORS to blatantly just choose elements out of the HTML like h1, p, body, and just change them at will. The classes can be assigned to anything in the page (mainly divs/spans/p) and can also be abbreviated as a period(.). IDs are another way to change the elements specifically and are abbreviated as a hashtag(#). The main difference between CLASS and ID, is that CLASS should be a group of things and ID should be a singular thing. You can also have multiple CLASSES on an element, but only one ID.-->
